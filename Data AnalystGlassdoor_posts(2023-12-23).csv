Data Analyst,Milu Health,Remote,30d+,,"WE MAKE HEALTHCARE AFFORDABLE FOR AMERICANS
Today, 112 million Americans have trouble paying for healthcare. Nearly 1 in 4 Americans have medical debt. Healthcare costs are skyrocketing, and patients are facing more of that financial burden. We started Milu Health to tackle this problem.


WHO WE ARE
Milu Health is an early stage startup focused on making healthcare affordable for Americans.

Using healthcare pricing data - a 500TB healthcare cost dataset that payers recently have had to release publicly for the first time ever - combined with other healthcare quality and claims data, we think we can change how employers and employees pay for healthcare and ultimately make high-quality medical care more affordable for patients.

Our tools comprise an operating system to reduce a patient's personal healthcare spend - from helping patients identify which high-quality and high-value doctors to go to for a procedure, to informing them about the most affordable prescription options for their medicines, to making sure their medical bills are correct. Through our entire stack, we engage patients through our consumer-facing products and cash-back incentives that can cover their out-of-pocket spend.

We're looking for the best people in the world to dig and build something great with us. It's not going to be easy. There's going to be twists and turns, successes and failures, and tons of learning. But we're in this for the long haul and believe we can fundamentally change a broken system.

Our founding team has spent the last combined 10 years building data-based healthcare businesses. Milu is backed by leading investors including a16z, Box Group, Steve Pagliuca, 81 Collection, Starting Line VC, Hypothesis Ventures and others.

THE ROLE
We're looking for a Data Analyst to join our team in our New York City or Evanston offices, or work remotely. As that data analyst, you will be responsible for querying, evaluating and understanding data outputs across all of our products, ultimately aimed at identifying cost savings opportunities and high quality medical options for patients. You will drive the scaleable analysis of data in a HIPAA-compliant environment. Ideally, you've previously done extensive healthcare claims data analysis and have experience working with CPT codes and other healthcare cost data. Most importantly, you're going to be an early data scientist on a growing team. You'll set our processes, culture and build the core infrastructure in the earliest days of the company. It's going to be a fun ride.

WHY WE'RE LOOKING FOR YOU

Maintain, update, and carry out routine but complex computational processes and statistical modeling that are central to generating estimates of key indicators.

Resolve intricate questions in order to respond to the needs of senior researchers and external requests from collaborators, media, policymakers, donors, and other stakeholders.

Media & Data Visualization Analyst,Applecart,"New York, NY",30d+,$70K - $85K (Employer est.),"Applecart was founded in recognition of a challenge: the most influential individuals – executives, investors, policymakers – have historically been the most difficult to access. Large organizations have often spent hundreds of millions of dollars to reach a handful of these people. Applecart's technology is designed to level the playing field.
Applecart is the leading technology platform creating a new category of ""Decision Maker Marketing"". From enterprise sales and corporate communications to government relations and employee engagement, the most sophisticated C-suite leaders use Applecart to manage their brand with business-critical decision makers such as policymakers, investors, CEOs, key employees, members of the media and more.
Traditional digital targeting technology can help organizations reach a mass audience, but it doesn't really move the needle on critical outcomes. Decision makers are informed by what they read, learn from advisors, hear from colleagues, and discuss with family and friends. To break through to them, you must reach them through the only channel that really moves them: those they know and trust. Applecart's platform uses publicly available or fully permissioned data to map billions of social relationships between nearly every American adult. By making this data addressable in a privacy compliant way, Applecart enables clients to market directly to decision makers and those that matter most to them.
A few quick facts about us:
Applecart's platform has been used by hundreds of industry-leading clients spanning Fortune 500 companies like Blackstone and Intuit, leading nonprofit organizations like the Environmental Defense Fund, and top-tier communications and public affairs firms like Teneo, Sard Verbinnen, and Weber Shandwick.
Applecart is growing quickly—over the last several years we've averaged 122% revenue growth year-over-year.
Our senior leadership team includes two members of the Forbes 30 under 30 list for Marketing and Advertising, the former Head of Product at Moat, Oracle's online ad measurement platform, a former senior White House advisor, an early sales leader at Google and Twitter, and two of the Democratic Party's most successful pollsters and strategists.
Our investors include global sports, entertainment and marketing giant Endeavor, KKR Co-Founder Henry Kravis, entrepreneur Chris Burch, a founder of Palantir, senior engineering leaders at Twitter and Yelp, former Fortune 50 and advertising agency CEOs, and a number of well-known venture capitalists. Endeavor CEO Ari Emanuel and Owl Capital Managing Partner Jennifer Fonstad serve on our board.
Our work has been featured on Morning Joe on MSNBC, Bloomberg and The Colbert Report, and in Axios, BusinessWeek, the Associated Press, Forbes, the Washington Post, and Politico, among many others.
About the Role
Applecart's Social Graph Platform and Decision Maker Targeting products are a critical part of our clients' strategic marketing. Fortune 50 companies, major financial firms, and leading trade associations use Applecart as an amplification layer for their ongoing communications and marketing to reach a broad cross-section of critical stakeholders, including CEOs, industry influencers, members of the media, elected officials, current and prospective employees, and investors.
Reporting on the audiences and advertising campaigns powered by Applecart across all of these communication strategies is key to our clients' success. In this critical role, you will conduct analysis and provide insights and client reporting as we grow our offering and client base.

Our Agency Mission and Office Culture:
The

(ODE’s) mission is to foster equity and excellence for every learner through collaboration with educators, partners, and communities. In fulfilling its
mission
, ODE has the vision to ensure all students have access to and benefit from a world-class, well–rounded, and equitable education system.
The Office of Enhancing Student Opportunities (OESO) supports educational facilities (schools, school districts, Educational Service Districts, Long Term Care Treatment Centers, Youth Corrections and Juvenile Detention Programs) by providing educational and technical assistance services for Special Education Programs and Federal Title Programs. Visit the
OESO About Us
page to learn more about the office’s teams and work units.
OESO seeks to build a culture of care and connection, one where people can help us make significant and important improvements in special education for the state of Oregon, while bringing their full, complicated human selves to the position. We are a primarily hybrid office. Our team members most often work from home, but are on site in various locations throughout Oregon due to business need.

Other cultural markers of our team include trust and accountability, and a commitment to “doing the work”. For trust and accountability, what that means to me is we have an incredibly talented team. We have to be able to trust deeply in one another to do the work well. And, that means, we also need a culture of accountability where people take it on themselves to ensure the right work is completed in the right way at the right time. We are, unapologetically, anti-racist, anti-ableist, and anti-oppressive in our approach to the work. We recognize that the systems we’ve built and maintain cause harm to certain communities, and that it’s our job to disrupt, dismantle, and transform those systems so that that is no longer the case.

Healthcare Claims Data Analyst,Milu Health,Remote,30d+,,"WE MAKE HEALTHCARE AFFORDABLE FOR AMERICANS
Today, 112 million Americans have trouble paying for healthcare. Nearly 1 in 4 Americans have medical debt. Healthcare costs are skyrocketing, and patients are facing more of that financial burden. We started Milu Health to tackle this problem.


WHO WE ARE
Milu Health is an early stage startup focused on making healthcare affordable for Americans.

Using healthcare pricing data - a 500TB healthcare cost dataset that payers recently have had to release publicly for the first time ever - combined with other healthcare quality and claims data, we think we can change how employers and employees pay for healthcare and ultimately make high-quality medical care more affordable for patients.

Our tools comprise an operating system to reduce a patient's personal healthcare spend - from helping patients identify which high-quality and high-value doctors to go to for a procedure, to informing them about the most affordable prescription options for their medicines, to making sure their medical bills are correct. Through our entire stack, we engage patients through our consumer-facing products and cash-back incentives that can cover their out-of-pocket spend.

We're looking for the best people in the world to dig and build something great with us. It's not going to be easy. There's going to be twists and turns, successes and failures, and tons of learning. But we're in this for the long haul and believe we can fundamentally change a broken system.

Our founding team has spent the last combined 10 years building data-based healthcare businesses. Milu is backed by leading investors including a16z, Box Group, Steve Pagliuca, 81 Collection, Starting Line VC, Hypothesis Ventures and others.

THE ROLE
We're looking for a Data Analyst to join our team in our New York City or Evanston offices, or work remotely. As that data analyst, you will be responsible for querying, evaluating and understanding data outputs across all of our products, ultimately aimed at identifying cost savings opportunities and high quality medical options for patients. You will drive the scaleable analysis of data in a HIPAA-compliant environment. Ideally, you've previously done extensive healthcare claims data analysis and have experience working with CPT codes and other healthcare cost data. Most importantly, you're going to be an early data scientist on a growing team. You'll set our processes, culture and build the core infrastructure in the earliest days of the company. It's going to be a fun ride.

WHY WE'RE LOOKING FOR YOU

3-5 years of data analysis experience, 1-2 years in healthcare

SELECTION PROCEDURES
Junior Administrative Analyst Core Exam (Weight: 100%)
Candidates self-certifying meeting the Minimum Qualifications will be invited to participate in the online Junior Administrative Analyst Core Exam. Candidates will be sent a web link via email that will allow them to take the online Junior Administrative Analyst Core Exam that is designed to measure knowledge, skills, and/or abilities in job-related areas which have been identified as critical for positions in the Junior Administrative Analyst classification.
This computer-administered test can be taken at home or at a time and location of one’s convenience, but only within the time period specified on the test notification. Candidates must have access to a computer and reliable internet connection to participate in this exam.
Score Banking: Scores attained on the Junior Administrative Analyst Core Exam will be 'banked' for three years, starting from the date of the examination. This means that, during this three-year time period, candidates need not take this test again. Rather, if another announcement you applied to and are deemed qualified for requires the Junior Administrative Analyst Core Exam and is held within one year of your Junior Administrative Analyst Core Exam date, your score will be automatically applied to that announcement. However, after one year, a candidate has the option to either (a) apply their test score to the other announcement or (b) re-take the test. Re-testing is permitted no sooner than one year from the date of the test and only in association with a candidate’s eligibility for another announcement to which the candidate has applied and is deemed qualified. If a candidate opts to re-test, the re-test score becomes the candidate’s official score since it is the most recent.
If a significant modification is made to this exam in the future, the application of “banked” scores may no longer be appropriate. In such a rare circumstance, candidates with “banked” scores would be required to re-take the exam sooner than the three-year period specified above should they apply to another job opportunity where the modified exam is used.
Eligible List/Score Report: A confidential eligible list of applicant names that have passed the civil service examination process will be created, and used for certification purposes only. An examination score report will be established, so applicants can view the ranks, final scores and number of eligible candidates. Applicant information, including names of applicants on the eligible list, shall not be made public unless required by law. However, an eligible list shall be made available for public inspection, upon request, once the eligible list is exhausted or expired and referrals resolved. The eligible list/score report resulting from this civil service examination process is subject to change after adoption (e.g., as a result of appeals), as directed by the Human Resources Director or the Civil Service Commission.
Upon passing the exam, candidates will be placed on the eligible list for a period of 12 months.
