The Attack Detection team's mission statement is to provide world-class detector efficacy to tackle changing attack landscape using a combination of generalizable and auto trained models as well as specific detectors for high value attack categories.
This team is solving a multi-layered detection problem, which involves modeling communication patterns to establish enterprise-wide baselines, incorporating these patterns as robust signals, and combining these signals with contextual information to create extremely precise systems. The team builds discriminative signals at various levels including message level (eg. presence of particular phrases), sender-level (eg.frequency of sender) and recipient level (eg.likelihood of receiving a safe message). These signals are then combined and utilized to train highly accurate model based as well as heuristic detectors. Additionally, to continuously adapt to new unseen attacks, the team builds out different stages in our automated model retraining pipelines including data analytics and generation stages, modeling stages, production evaluation stages as well as automated deployment stages.
This role would also have an opportunity to have a significant impact on the overall charter, direction and roadmap of the team.

Machine Learning Engineer,Ntropy Network,"New York, NY",30d+,$130K (Employer est.),"Over the last few decades, technological innovation has relied on democratizing some of its key ingredients: knowledge (open publishing platforms), algorithms (code repositories) and computing (cloud providers). However, the last key component, data, largely remains trapped behind barriers of regulation, privacy, schema standards and competitive risk. Enabling scalable access to data will unlock enormous value for both individual developers and companies. This has only been made possible in the last few years, through advances in manifold learning algorithms and privacy-preserving computing. See our blog for more details.

One of the most valuable kinds of data today is in the financial sector. Financial data plays a key role across many industry verticals. However, it has notoriously been locked behind regulatory barriers and a lack of format standards. Our end product is an API that makes financial transactions accessible to both humans and machine-learning models, in a scalable and privacy-preserving way.

We
- come from various fields - engineering, mathematics, physics and arts.
- are allergic to over-engineering.
- are anarchists at heart and like to hack around the status quo.
love playing board and video games.
- are radically honest and appreciate challenging one another, rather than giving out “pats on the back”. Yet, we can always rely on each other for support, feedback and results.
- are willing to learn and adapt quickly to new situations and requirements. Languages, frameworks, libraries, compilers, etc. are just tools for a job. A new problem might need a new tool. If it doesn’t exist yet, we will build it.
- have a sense of humor (well, we think we do).

As an early member of our ML engineering team, you will help
- push the limits of cutting-edge computing and machine learning
- build the team and drive the direction of the company.
- shape our product and culture.
- experience the direct impact of what you build on hundreds of millions of people’s financial lives.

The following is a big plus
- fluency in Python, Rust and PyTorch
- experience with training and deploying models in multi-GPU environments
- recognized open-source contributions
- participation in competitive programming events (CTFs, Putnam, IOI, IMO, IPHO, Topcoder, Kaggle, etc.)

Hybrid policy & visa sponsorship: Currently, we expect all staff to be in our office at least 25% of the time. We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate; operations roles are especially difficult to support. But if we make you an offer, we will make every effort to get you into the United States or United Kingdom, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.

We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.

Compensation and Benefits*
Anthropic’s compensation package consists of three elements: salary, equity, and benefits. We are committed to pay fairness and aim for these three elements collectively to be highly competitive with market rates.

Equity - On top of this position's salary (listed above), equity will be a major component of the total compensation. We aim to offer higher-than-average equity compensation for a company of our size, and communicate equity amounts at the time of offer issuance.

The level of pay within the range will depend on a variety of job-related factors, including where you place on our internal performance ladders, which is based on factors including past work experience, relevant education, and performance on our interviews or in a work trial.

How we're different
We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. We do not have boundaries between engineering and research, and we expect all of our technical staff to contribute to both as needed.

The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.

Come work with us!

Posted: Dec 19, 2023

Weekly Hours: 40

Role Number:200524853

This role will focus on the development of command line tools embedded in iOS and MacOS for measuring the performance of Machine Learning inference; AND the role will focus on the integration of those command line tools into Apple’s internal measurement service for on-device Machine Learning inference performance. Time is likely to be split roughly 50/50 in these two areas. For example, one challenge could be to start with layer by layer performance data from a compute backend and map it up to a higher level representation so that model authors can reason about their inference performance. Another challenge could be to leverage kernel APIs to map out all memory allocations from the inference stack and accurately report this to users. In this role you can expect to be working on a diverse and forward looking set of ML model architectures and will provide the tools and systems to understand their performance!

"Research Engineer, RSP Evaluations",Anthropic,"San Francisco, CA",2d,$320K - $485K (Employer est.),"We are looking for Research Engineers to build “gold standard” evaluations for catastrophic risks, in order to understand what AI Safety Level (ASL) to assign to models. This will have major implications for the way we train, deploy, and secure our models, as detailed in our Responsible Scaling Policy (RSP).

The policy defines a series of capability thresholds – AI Safety Levels (ASLs) – that represent increasing risks – crossing an ASL threshold would trigger a commitment to more stringent safety, security, and operational measures, intended to handle the increased level of risk.

Our evaluations teams have recently expanded, so we will not be actively hiring again until early 2024. However, we are still looking for expressions of interest in both teams - one focused on Autonomous Replication and Adaption (ARA) threats, one focused on CBRN and cyber threats, and a potentially expanded set of evaluation work streams in the future. By default we will reach out to candidates in the new year, or perhaps earlier for exploratory conversations. However, we would consider making offers to strong candidates on an earlier timeline if needed – there is also an option to indicate you would need an earlier response on the application form.
Responsibilities:
Research Engineers will be responsible for designing and running the evaluations needed to measure dangerous capabilities in models, and determine when we cross an ASL threshold.
You’ll work with world class experts in fields like biosecurity, autonomous replication, cybersecurity, and national security, and experiment with new evals, in order to measure how risky AI systems are.
Done well, this will inform decisions at the highest levels of the company
You may be a good fit if you:
Have an ML-focused background and engineering and research skills (e.g. experience in Python)
Are driven to find solutions to ambiguously scoped problems
Design and run experiments and iterate quickly to solve machine learning problems
Thrive in collaborative environment (we love pair programming!)
Have experience training, working with, and prompting models

For all workstreams, experience designing and building evaluations would be valuable, but is definitely not essential. For National Security threats workstreams, we will particularly value experience working on confidential or sensitive projects and demonstrated integrity, responsibility, and trustworthiness. We will also value domain specific knowledge, although it is not necessary. For ARA threats workstreams, we would value experience with language model agents, although this is not essential.
Sample Projects:
CBRN risks – working with external experts in the field of biosecurity to design clear and repeatable CBRN evaluations, based on a summary of dangerous biological capabilities. Using our post training infrastructure to prepare new generations of models for routine evaluations.
Cyber risks – working with external cyber experts to co-design a set of clear and repeatable cyber evaluations. This is likely to involve building custom environments or additions onto existing tooling and infrastructure, or locating specialized datasets.
ARA risks – building infrastructure and tooling for testing for these capabilities, and iterating with external ARA experts to scope possible tasks. This will involve building custom “testing environments” and new infrastructure.
Annual Salary (USD)
The expected salary range for this position is $320k-$485k
We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.

Compensation and Benefits*
Anthropic’s compensation package consists of three elements: salary, equity, and benefits. We are committed to pay fairness and aim for these three elements collectively to be highly competitive with market rates.

Equity - On top of this position's salary (listed above), equity will be a major component of the total compensation. We aim to offer higher-than-average equity compensation for a company of our size, and communicate equity amounts at the time of offer issuance.

US Benefits - The following benefits are for our US-based employees:
Optional equity donation matching at a 3:1 ratio, up to 50% of your equity grant.
Comprehensive health, dental, and vision insurance for you and all your dependents.
401(k) plan with 4% matching.
21 weeks of paid parental leave.
Unlimited PTO – most staff take between 4-6 weeks each year, sometimes more!
Stipends for education, home office improvements, commuting, and wellness.
Fertility benefits via Carrot.
Daily lunches and snacks in our office.
Relocation support for those moving to the Bay Area.

UK Benefits - The following benefits are for our UK-based employees:
Optional equity donation matching at a 3:1 ratio, up to 50% of your equity grant.
Private health, dental, and vision insurance for you and your dependents.
Pension contribution (matching 4% of your salary).
21 weeks of paid parental leave.
Unlimited PTO – most staff take between 4-6 weeks each year, sometimes more!
Health cash plan.
Life insurance and income protection.
Daily lunches and snacks in our office.

This compensation and benefits information is based on Anthropic’s good faith estimate for this position as of the date of publication and may be modified in the future. Employees based outside of the UK or US will receive a different benefits package. The level of pay within the range will depend on a variety of job-related factors, including where you place on our internal performance ladders, which is based on factors including past work experience, relevant education, and performance on our interviews or in a work trial.

How we're different
We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. We do not have boundaries between engineering and research, and we expect all of our technical staff to contribute to both as needed.

The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.

About the Cornell Lab of Ornithology
The Cornell Lab of Ornithology is a major, globally focused institution for research, training, and public communication relating to birds and biodiversity. The Center for Avian Population Studies (CAPS) is one of the programmatic units that carry out the Lab’s mission to interpret and conserve the earth’s biological diversity through research, education, and citizen science focused on birds. One of the major projects in CAPS is eBird, which collects information about the distribution and abundance of birds, taking advantage of the enormous popularity of watching birds to create a global network of volunteers who submit bird observations via the web to a central data repository. With this data, scientists at CAPS use machine learning and statistical methods to combine observations of birds with habitat information from satellites to make predictions of bird occurrence, abundance, and trends at a high spatiotemporal resolution. This project, known as eBird Status and Trends, represents a valuable resource for informing conservation decision making and resource management.

The Opportunity
While position responsibilities vary, every member of our community is expected to foster a culture of belonging and a psychologically healthy work environment by communicating across differences; being cooperative, collaborative, open, and welcoming; showing respect, compassion, and empathy; engaging and supporting others regardless of background or perspective; speaking up when others are being excluded or treated inappropriately; and supporting work/life integration of oneself and others.

This will include managing, updating, running, and designing machine and deep learning workflows and scripts that perform big data spatiotemporal analyses with tools like Slurm for job submission, monitoring, and control. The Data Engineer will develop, test, code, and maintain data resources that are provided for data intensive analysis processes, while working in a collaborative development environment. This includes utilizing software development tools like R, Python, team code repositories, and open source libraries. An important goal is to develop software and data products to ensure the data collected by eBird are available and appropriately used to the maximum extent possible by conservationists and researchers. Software produced by the Information Science and Technology Program generally includes R, Python, and SQLite, Parquet, and PostgreSQL backends, all running on Linux operating systems.

What is Amplemarket all about?
Amplemarket's premise is that a lot of the playbooks used by B2B sales teams that worked 5 years ago don't cut it anymore.
In today's environment, sales teams need to have a tremendous amount of information about their prospects to decide when is the best moment and channel to reach out in the most relevant way. You can't do this with 5 different data/sales enablement point solutions that don't share the same data schema and barely communicate with each other. Amplemarket is the all-in-one compound solution that enables this.
Our AI-powered sales platform helps B2B companies generate more opportunities thanks to our advanced lead generation engine, hyper-personalized sequencing, omnichannel outreach, and AI-powered smart actions. We are backed by Y Combinator, and we are powering the sales teams at some of the fastest-growing companies in the world like Deel, Moveworks, H1 and Vanta.

Customer Support Engineer,Accountable2You,"Williamstown, KY",24h,$50K - $80K (Employer est.),"We're growing and looking for our next Customer Support Engineer to join our team! Do you share our passion for accountability, love our core values, enjoy technology, and possess excellent written and spoken communication skills? Read on!

What’s the starting salary range?
Depending on your customer service and technical support experience, this full-time salaried role offers between $50,000 and $80,000 annually.

What makes the A2U support team different?
We're a support-driven company. This means everything we do at Accountable2You centers around growth through service to our customers. Most companies view customer support as a cost center, a leaky bucket that receives as few resources as possible.

At A2U, we believe that support-driven growth is a wholesome, ethical way to grow a company that centers around meeting needs. Customer Support is central to our business model, essential to our vision, and vital to our shared success.

What does a normal day look like?
As a Customer Support Engineer, you will need to master the deeper workings of our software as most of our work centers around things our customers encounter: Troubleshooting software issues on various device types, explaining our software and website, fixing billing problems, and training customers on best practices with our software. The constant advancements within Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, Apple iOS, and Chrome OS also allow us a wealth of technical topics to learn and master each day.

As a CS Engineer, you’ll also be expected to learn about our backend technology stack over time as you’ll frequently serve as the liaison between customer support and DevOps; you’ll want to know the fundamentals of our VPN servers, activity record ingestion, and API functions so you’ll become equipped to communicate with our product and DevOps teams regularly. While you won’t necessarily write our technical documentation, your expertise will be leaned upon heavily to review our customer-facing documentation for technical accuracy as we roll out software updates.

While you might not be a software developer, you’ll spend about 20% of your week in project-type troubleshooting tasks, using the various virtual machines you create and maintain to suit your test cases and isolate bugs in our production software.

Our Customer Support team handles incoming technical and account-related emails, chats, phone calls, social media messages and works together on improving our processes, customer documentation, and learning (and testing) our technology.

It’s important to note that while our support team is customer-facing, we don’t operate in a call center or a “sweatshop” dynamic. Customer Support spends a great deal of time designing processes, improving our customer-facing content, and documenting our technology. You’ll be expected to jump in alongside the other customer support team members when things are busy (60-80% of the week).

Our Customer Support team doesn't offer counseling services to our customers. Yet, we listen with compassion and empathy and then move forward with recommendations to better utilize our software in the customer's unique situation.

While many of our customers use our software to keep would-be temptations at bay and confirm their integrity, others struggle deeply with pornography and other addictive behaviors. As you help your team serve customers, you may encounter vulgar and offensive words – but we've intentionally prevented our software from capturing images or links to the objectionable content. We do our best to guard our team against objectionable content, and under no circumstances will you need to examine offensive websites or material.

About you
You’re an outstanding human. We get it, no one is perfect, yet you possess a strong moral character that loves our core values and affirms Accountable2You's mission and purpose.
You believe the struggle is real. You count bondage to pornography and other addictive behavior as serious matters. You’re committed to helping people in their journey toward life change.
You’re experienced in tech support. We’re looking for at least 3 years of experience in a technical support role (desktop support, system administration, network administration, etc.). Bonus points if written communication between you and your customers comprised over 50% of your interactions.
You’re a veteran with SaaS software and technology. We provide extensive training on our products, but you won’t need any training on the common software tool stack; you’ve been there and done that. If you haven’t used it before, you know how to find the answer and learn the tool because you do this all the time.
You’re a natural communicator. While you don’t need to be an extrovert, it does mean that those who know you best would say you thrive in environments that rely upon clear written and spoken communication. You’re always keen to learn new ways to use tone and voice in your customer interactions effectively. You know how to make a customer smile or deescalate a tense situation. You can document even the most confusing error or bug in an understandable and relatable way; both DevOps and customer support understand what you’re saying.
You’re a resourceful learner and a natural teacher. You’re naturally curious and love the art of “asking the better question” that reveals the actual need. You have a long list of techniques for navigating complex or confusing situations. You might not be a developer, but you’re resourceful: you know how to test your hypothesis, isolate bugs, and find answers. You're a gifted peer-mentor who can humbly guide your teammates as they handle challenging technical questions.
You’re highly empathetic and see things from the other person’s point of view. You know that everyone possesses unique skills and life experiences, so you default toward kindness and patience rather than critique and judgment. You make people feel empowered after interacting with you rather than stupid because of a knowledge gap or small mistake. Your teammates depend upon your ability to see the technical factors behind a problem.
You’re eager to grow personally and professionally. Like a world-class athlete working with a coach, you want to know what you did well and what you can do better next time. Excellence matters to you. At A2U, we all view feedback as the means to grow and improve toward excellence. That means we’re quick to learn from our mistakes and quick to extend grace to others amid their mistakes, too.
You’re persistent and love solving problems. There are few easy answers here, and this excites you. Every customer is a real person with bespoke needs and emotional predispositions. Likewise, every device is different and poses unique challenges. You don’t quit until you’ve done the hard work to research and answer the question at hand.
You love discovering a better way. Like us, you feel the adage, “faster is better” isn’t quite right. Instead, you believe that “better is faster,” so you’re always on the lookout for new efficiencies and a better way forward. Speed improves with efficiency and experience, and you’ve built a fair bit of both. You love building a process, seeking clarity, and creating unity through standardization.
You’re a flexible and proactive doer. You don’t wait for someone to tell you what to do next. You own your work, and you’re always looking for the next opportunity to meet a need, serve customers, or help your team. You see trends and rally your peers to take action. You know how to escalate critical matters to management or take the lead when it’s within your scope.

Requirements
A minimum of three years of experience in a technical support role, preferably in an IT department or DevOps team
A genuine delight in serving customers and meeting needs
Mastery in explaining complex concepts with a tone that reflects a kind, honest, and confident clarity

"Software Engineer, Trust & Safety",Anthropic,United States,1d,$300K - $450K (Employer est.),"We are looking for software engineers to help build safety and oversight mechanisms for our AI systems. As a trust and safety software engineer, you will work to monitor models, prevent misuse, and ensure user well-being. This role will focus on building systems to detect unwanted model behaviors and prevent disallowed use of models. You will apply your technical skills to uphold our principles of safety, transparency, and oversight while enforcing our terms of service and acceptable use policies.

About Anthropic
Anthropic is an AI safety and research company that’s working to build reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our customers and for society as a whole. Our interdisciplinary team has experience across ML, physics, policy, business and product.
Responsibilities:
Develop monitoring systems to detect unwanted behaviors from our API partners and potentially take automated enforcement actions; surface these in internal dashboards to analysts for manual review
Build abuse detection mechanisms
Surface abuse patterns to our research teams to harden models at the training stage
Build multi-layered defenses for real-time improvement of safety mechanisms
Analyze user reports of inappropriate content or accounts and build machine learning models to detect similar instances proactively
You may be a good fit if you:
Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Software Engineering or comparable experience
2-3 years of experience in a data analyst, data scientist, or software engineering position, preferably with a focus on security, spam, fraud, or abuse detection.
Proficiency in SQL, Python, and data analysis/data mining tools.
Strong communication skills and ability to explain complex technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders
Strong candidates may also:
Have experience building trust and safety mechanisms for AI/ML systems, such as fraud detection models or security monitoring tools

Have worked closely with operational teams to build custom internal tooling
Have experience with full stack engineering to build internal tooling
Annual Salary
The expected salary range for this position is $300k - $450k USD.

Hybrid policy & US visa sponsorship: Currently, we expect all staff to be in our office at least 25% of the time. We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate; operations roles are especially difficult to support. But if we make you an offer, we will make every effort to get you into the United States, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.

We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.

Compensation and Benefits*
Anthropic’s compensation package consists of three elements: salary, equity, and benefits. We are committed to pay fairness and aim for these three elements collectively to be highly competitive with market rates.

Equity - On top of this position's salary (listed above), equity will be a major component of the total compensation. We aim to offer higher-than-average equity compensation for a company of our size, and communicate equity amounts at the time of offer issuance.

US Benefits - The following benefits are for our US-based employees:
Optional equity donation matching at a 3:1 ratio, up to 50% of your equity grant.
Comprehensive health, dental, and vision insurance for you and all your dependents.
401(k) plan with 4% matching.
21 weeks of paid parental leave.
Unlimited PTO – most staff take between 4-6 weeks each year, sometimes more!
Stipends for education, home office improvements, commuting, and wellness.
Fertility benefits via Carrot.
Daily lunches and snacks in our office.
Relocation support for those moving to the Bay Area.

UK Benefits - The following benefits are for our UK-based employees:
Optional equity donation matching at a 3:1 ratio, up to 50% of your equity grant.
Private health, dental, and vision insurance for you and your dependents.
Pension contribution (matching 4% of your salary).
21 weeks of paid parental leave.
Unlimited PTO – most staff take between 4-6 weeks each year, sometimes more!
Health cash plan.
Life insurance and income protection.
Daily lunches and snacks in our office.

This compensation and benefits information is based on Anthropic’s good faith estimate for this position as of the date of publication and may be modified in the future. Employees based outside of the UK or US will receive a different benefits package. The level of pay within the range will depend on a variety of job-related factors, including where you place on our internal performance ladders, which is based on factors including past work experience, relevant education, and performance on our interviews or in a work trial.

How we're different
We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. We do not have boundaries between engineering and research, and we expect all of our technical staff to contribute to both as needed.

The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.

How we're different
We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. We do not have boundaries between engineering and research, and we expect all of our technical staff to contribute to both as needed.

The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.

But if we make you an offer, we will make every effort to get you into the United States, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.

We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.

Compensation and Benefits*
Anthropic’s compensation package consists of three elements: salary, equity, and benefits. We are committed to pay fairness and aim for these three elements collectively to be highly competitive with market rates.

Equity - On top of this position's salary (listed above), equity will be a major component of the total compensation. We aim to offer higher-than-average equity compensation for a company of our size, and communicate equity amounts at the time of offer issuance.

US Benefits - The following benefits are for our US-based employees:
Optional equity donation matching at a 3:1 ratio, up to 50% of your equity grant.
Comprehensive health, dental, and vision insurance for you and all your dependents.
401(k) plan with 4% matching.
21 weeks of paid parental leave.
Unlimited PTO – most staff take between 4-6 weeks each year, sometimes more!
Stipends for education, home office improvements, commuting, and wellness.
Fertility benefits via Carrot.

Relocation support for those moving to the Bay Area.

UK Benefits - The following benefits are for our UK-based employees:
Optional equity donation matching at a 3:1 ratio, up to 50% of your equity grant.
Private health, dental, and vision insurance for you and your dependents.
Pension contribution (matching 4% of your salary).
21 weeks of paid parental leave.
Unlimited PTO – most staff take between 4-6 weeks each year, sometimes more!
Health cash plan.
Life insurance and income protection.

This compensation and benefits information is based on Anthropic’s good faith estimate for this position as of the date of publication and may be modified in the future. Employees based outside of the UK or US will receive a different benefits package. The level of pay within the range will depend on a variety of job-related factors, including where you place on our internal performance ladders, which is based on factors including past work experience, relevant education, and performance on our interviews or in a work trial.

How we're different
We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. We do not have boundaries between engineering and research, and we expect all of our technical staff to contribute to both as needed.

The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.

We can provide you with space outside of your home to work if you need to (e.g. co-working offices), or help get your home to be more accommodating to work.
We do not trap people in front of their screens or lock them in overtime. Just the opposite. We’re all about reasonable working hours and ample vacation time. See our employee handbook here.
How To Apply
We want to get a sense of how you think and work. To that end, please be prepared to share with us your take on the following:

Applied Machine Learning Engineer,Nooks,United States,30d+,$140K - $240K (Employer est.),"What is Nooks?
Nooks is a platform transforming sales reps from manual laborers to scientists. With today's technology, sales reps shouldn't need to manually write hundreds of emails, research hundreds of websites/linkedins, and make hundreds of calls. They should instead focus on the parts of their job that actually require people - talking to customers, being creative, and problem-solving. With a combination of AI tools, automation and real-time collaboration, Nooks can do the rest.
About Nooks
The team: Nooks is ~30 people. Engineering & product are mostly in SF and go to our office 2-3x/week. The go-to-market team is distributed across the U.S.
The founders (Dan, Rohan, and Nikhil) met studying AI at Stanford, have published in top AI journals, Forbes 30u30, worked at Scale AI, Tesla Autopilot, etc.
The engineering team has won international math & physics olympiads, has experience at Google, Facebook, Slack, Quora, Scale AI, Bolt, Snap, Flexport, and other fast-growing startups.
The sales team have been top-performers at companies like Gong, Amplitude, LeadIQ, and Orum.
Fundraising: we've raised ~$20M in venture capital from top-tier investors. $15M in a recent (un-announced) Series A
Fast growth: in 16 months (since June ‘22) we've grown $0 $2.5M ARR. So far in 2023 we've grown over 3x and expect to 4x by EOY.
The problem
Sales pipeline is critical for growing companies. Many, especially B2B companies, have teams of sales/business development representatives (SDR/BDRs) or full-cycle account executives whose responsibility is to identify, contact, and qualify new potential customers. There are ~750,000 SDR/BDR's in the US alone (e.g. Airtable (https://boards.greenhouse.io/airtable/jobs/6744435002), Brex (https://www.brex.com/careers/6850017002), Databricks (https://www.databricks.com/company/careers/sales-development/business-development-representative-6933516002) and many other tech companies have sizable SDR/BDR teams)
In their day-to-day, SDR/BDRs spend time on 3 main activities:
Prospecting & research - identify a list of potential customers using signals like industry, size, fundraising, headcount growth, new hires, job descriptions, etc.
Email & LinkedIn messaging - write messages to those contacts to convey the problem and pitch your product. The goal is for them to book a demo
Calling - Live phone conversations often have higher conversion than emails because they're more personal, but there's a lot more manual work involved
Most of the sales rep's job can be automated with today's technology: large language models, web scraping, automation, integrations, etc.
Nooks today

Our customers use Nooks for most of their day (avg ~3hrs/business day). Nooks currently owns end-to-end workflows around sales calls:
AI dialer - automates the manual parts of the calling process: skipping answering machines, leaving voicemails, taking notes, logging calls, even figuring out what to say on a call
Analytics - we record, transcribe, and analyze every call. Since these are all outbound calls with little context, these calls follow similar structure - opener, pitch, questions/objections, ask for meeting, etc. So we can answer questions like: “which reps struggle to book the meeting with prospects who showed interest” or “what are the most common objections across each of our key personas”
Salesfloor - sales reps & managers can work together throughout the day, listen to each others' calls, give real-time advice, coaching, shadowing, onboarding, training.
Teams that use Nooks often see a 2-3x increase in reps' productivity within weeks! And we're working on adding prospecting / research workflows (to-be-announced soon!)
(https://app.nooks.in/demoroom)
The role
Note: Exact job title will be commensurate with experience
We have an ambitious product vision in a nascent area - AI-powered realtime collaboration - so there are a ton of interesting technical challenges on our roadmap. We're hiring our first Machine Learning Engineer. This is a role focused on implementing ML features into Nooks. Our ideal candidate will have prior experience working in industry for a business where ML is a core part of the offering.
Responsibilities will include training production models to improve their accuracy for specific sales use cases. You will align our technical strategy with performance, cost and feasibility considerations.
Examples of engineering problems you may touch
These are just examples, this list is non-exhaustive, and you definitely don't need experience in all of these areas. But hopefully you find some of them exciting!
Realtime audio AI & precision/recall/latency tradeoffs (algorithms & models)
We use audio data, transcription, silence detection, and several other signals to detect whether a live phone call is a voicemail, a human, or a dial tree. Here, latency is a third factor added to the standard precision/recall tradeoff because it's important we can detect humans quickly. Our approach involves LLM embeddings, few-shot learning, data labeling, and continuous monitoring of model performance in prod.
Smart call funnels & playbooks (data wrangling, backend eng, GPT-3, UX)
At what point in the conversation do my reps get stuck? What are the toughest questions that we need to address? Can I “program” a playbook so that Nooks will help my team standardize toward best-practices? We're using GPT-3 and other LLM's to turn companies' mostly unstructured call data into actionable strategies & feedback loops.
Conversation embeddings & markov models (ML modeling)
What does the anatomy of a call look like? If I say XYZ, what are the different ways the prospect might answer and the probabilities of each? Conditioned on the first half of the call, what do I say next to maximize the likelihood that I book a demo at the end of the call? Can we use LLM's to generate embeddings of conversations that we can use to cluster similar conversation patterns and predict where the conversation is headed?
Requirements
Bachelor's or Master's degree in Computer Science, Machine Learning, Data Science, or a related field.
3+ years of industry experience, including 2+ years training and deploying ML models in production.
Full stack ML Eng chops: proficiency in general purposes programming languages such as Python/Javascript, and with libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, scikit-learn etc.
Expertise in areas like NLP, Deep Learning, Anomaly Detection, Transformers and Large Language Models.
Nice to haves:
Background in an analytical field like heuristics, data science &/or statistics
Prior experiences working in both startup and research environments
We offer competitive compensation because we want to hire the best people and reward them for their contributions to our mission. We pay all employees competitively relative to market. In compliance with pay transparency laws and in pursuit of pay equity and fairness, we publish salary ranges for our open roles. The target salary range for this role is $140,000 - $240,000. On top of base salary, we also offer equity, generous perks and comprehensive benefits.",2.4,Size1 to 50 Employees,Founded--,TypeCompany - Private,Industry--,Sector--,RevenueUnknown / Non-Applicable

On-site position in College Station, TX. US Persons. Multiple positions. $52k - $85k + Benefits

The Intelligent Systems Group at Lynntech is developing new technologies through Research and Development (R&D) to come up with solution to frontier challenges in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning (ML), and Data Science. We operate in a collaborative multi-disciplinary environment, where projects lie at the intersection of evolving technical fields, focusing on Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (ISR) and Security, Navigation and Tracking, and Healthcare and Life Sciences.

Position Summary
The Intelligent System Group at Lynntech is a team of about 10 scientists, engineers, and programmers seeking to double its size over the next year. To that end, we are seeking full-time ML engineers to support existing projects while working alongside our scientists and other engineers. ML engineers are responsible for assembling data sets for testing models and methods, finding available models which are appropriate for the data processing needs of a specific project, setting up computational environments, and building and testing models. Due to the exploratory and interdisciplinary nature of our projects, duties associated with ML often overlap and intersect with those from other disciplines, such as data analytics and synthesis, as well as software and algorithm development. Thus, familiarity with disciplines outside of ML are valuable and domain expertise in other fields provides a novel context for application of ML methods.
For some of our more nascent projects, pre-existing data sets are not always available, so there is also a strong data acquisition (DAQ) and data synthesis aspect to our work. To that end, some projects involve working with hardware and sensors, most notably cameras. Projects may require operating DAQ systems and going out and collecting field or lab data. Other projects have virtual environments set up in which 3D models and simulations are used for creating training data using rendering engines, physics-based modeling software, and finite element analysis tools.

Responsibilities and Opportunities for Experience
Machine Learning
Train and evaluate neural networks for computer vision tasks, such as object detection.
Build a software package that automatically annotates image datasets.
Fine-tune pre-trained image classification models to adapt them to project needs.
Rapidly prototype and evaluate different models and algorithms.
Develop software to automate model hyperparameter tuning and loss function selection.

The Team
The Intelligent Systems Group at Lynntech is developing new technologies through Research and Development (R&D) to come up with solution to frontier challenges in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning (ML), and Data Science. We operate in a collaborative multi-disciplinary environment, where projects often lie at the intersection of different technical fields, broadly falling into one of the three industry domains:
Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (ISR) and Security
Navigation and Tracking
Healthcare and Life Sciences
Within these domains we work to generate, plan, and execute highly innovative solutions in the fields of AI, state-of-the-art electro-optical/infrared, embedded navigation systems, human-machine interfaces, and other resources to solve real-world problems such as search and rescue, analysis of geospatial data to provide actionable intelligence, terrain monitoring, disaster recovery, computer vision for autonomous vehicles, assistive technologies for disabled users, data analytics, natural language processing, and mobile computing for Internet of Things (IoT) applications.
As part of our ongoing research efforts, we continuously evaluate topics from government-released R&D solicitations and write research proposals in response. Upon competitive selection for contract award, such proposals become active research projects. Our team has several such R&D projects running in parallel. Each project is coordinated by one of our Principal Investigators (PI) who are responsible for supervising and delegating workloads between projects and it is common for scientists, engineers, and analysists to be involved in two to three projects simultaneously.

Why should you work at Lynntech?
Employee Benefits and perks of the position and area:
Opportunities to pursue R&D interests through government grants with full support of our Project Management Office (PMO) for assisting with the application process and document submission

A day in the life with the Intelligent Systems Group
Our projects lie at the interface between fundamental research and engineering, and we are often adapting ideas from disparate academic fields and finding ways to apply them in various real-world domains. We have several R&D projects running in parallel, and work focus shifts according to different project needs and deadlines. Each project is coordinated by one of our Principal Investigators (PI) who are responsible for supervising and delegating workloads between projects and it is common for scientists, engineers, and analysists to be involved in two to three projects simultaneously. You will start off working on individual tasks and filling in singular needs but over time be given responsibility for developing and maintaining larger pieces of projects and owning your own systems. We encourage our group members' growth and provide opportunities for taking on more responsibility, eventually leading projects and deciding the direction of future research.
Our projects leverage the following core disciplines:
Computer Vision, Image Processing, and Numerical Methods
Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing
Simulation, 3D Modeling, and Image Synthesis
Remote Sensing and Geospatial Analytics
State Estimation, Filtering, and Statistical Analysis
Data Acquisition, Synthesis, Wrangling, and Processing
Software Development and Sys Admin
Research, Proposal Writing, Grantsmanship, and Business Development
Even though you will start off focusing on one specific domain, team members are frequently involved on multiple projects with duties that span across these core disciplines. It is perfectly acceptable if find yourself slowly branching out or changing disciplines as your interests change and certain projects gain more traction than others. Branching out takes the form of joining existing projects or working on proposals to start new ones. Each of us is involved to some degree with the evaluation of government-released research solicitations. When batches of solicitations are released by various government entities, like NASA or the Department of Defense, for example, we come together as a team and decide on which ones we should pursue and who will lead efforts on writing proposals to the selected topics.

Interview Process
After applicants have submitted their application, our interviews follow a four-step process:
Pre-screening and request for work sample. If an applicant's resume passes pre-screening, Lynntech will send out a candidate packet which contains information about the company and the team. We will also request a work sample which is demonstrative of the applicant's experience relevant to the job posting. If the work sample demonstrates relevant proficiency in the job domain, Lynntech will continue with scheduling a time for an interview.
1st Interview (Usually Phone/Virtual unless local candidate). [Duration: 1 hr] During this call, both parties will review background information and review eligibility requirements. Company policies, job expectations, work environment, and availability will be discussed. The interview may conclude here if the candidate is no longer interested in pursuing the opportunity or if the candidate does not meet basic eligibility requirements. We will also discuss the different roles in the group and establish the domain specific project needs which we have at that moment and candidate will be asked to rank their experience and comfort level with the various core disciplines. Candidates will be expected to elaborate on their relevant past project experience.
Candidate Assessment, Part 1: If both parties choose to continue, candidates will be asked to complete and submit Part 1 of the Assessment which was included in their packets. This assessment covers fundamentals in computer literacy, programming, and mathematics. Lynntech will review the submission and before scheduling a second interview. Part 2 of the assessment is only requested if a second interview is scheduled.
2nd Interview (Usually On-site*) and Part 2 of Assessment. [Duration: 3 to 4 hr] If both parties choose to continue, an in-person interview will be scheduled, and the candidate is responsible for completing Part 2 of the assessment prior to the second interview. The candidate will be notified in advance if an optional domain specific assignment or live coding interview is required. This final step will be comprised of the following:
Past Project Presentation/Demo: The candidate will give a 10-15 minute presentation/demonstration of a past personal or professional project which relates to one of our core disciplines. Your presentation should resemble more of a story than an academic talk and it can be an example from your past personal or professional experience. If you have physical or virtual demonstrations at hand, or something interactive, you're encouraged to bring them. It's also beneficial if you have pictures/graphics and videos walking us through your development process and showing the final result. Highlight any problems or challenges you faced along the way and how you overcame them. There will be time at the end for Q&A and open discussion. If you're uncertain about what topic to present on, please reference our technical domains for guidance. Duration: 25 to 45 min
Project Domains and Core Disciplines Discussion: We will discuss what the existing project needs are and how the candidate's skill set can best fit the project needs. We will review the various roles, responsibilities, and how the various core disciplines relate to our projects. Duration: 30 to 40 min
[Optional] Assessment Review: If reviewers have previously provided a domain specific assignment, candidate answers will be reviewed, and additional questions may be given. Interviewers will assess candidate's ability to reason through challenges and their ability to identify and test their assumptions when approaching problems. Duration: 30 to 60 min
[Optional] Live Coding Interview: A live open-book set of coding problems. Candidates will be given programming problems which they must solve. Internet search will be available for looking up information and interviewers will be there to answer questions and help if necessary. This will test not only the candidate's ability to program, but also their ability to search for answers and ask for help and collaborate when appropriate. Duration: 30 to 60 min
For long-distance candidates, this may be a virtual interview. If a job offer is made the candidate will be invited to for an on-site visit before a final response is expected.

1 in 4 people in the US have a treatable mental health condition, but the majority of providers don’t accept insurance, making therapy too expensive for most people. Headway is building a new mental healthcare system that everyone can access by making it easy for therapists to take insurance and scale their practice.
Headway was founded in 2019 – since then, we’ve grown into a diverse, national network of over 25,000 mental healthcare providers across all 50 states who run their practice on our software. We’re a Series C company with over $225m in funding from a16z (Andreessen Horowitz), Accel, GV (formerly Google Ventures), Spark Capital, Thrive Capital, and Health Care Service Corporation.

Ship small, learn fast: We are building new and novel products and believe that we learn what our users need by quickly shipping and iteration.
Everything is a product: Whether it's our patient search experience or a developer productivity improvement, we treat everything we build at Headway as a product with end-users in mind.
Optimize for trust: We believe that engineers should be continually learning. To learn effectively and to be productive, engineers must feel safe asking questions and discussing mistakes.

Cloud infrastructure experience (AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.)
Working knowledge of one or more high-level programming languages (Python, Java, Scala, etc.)
Working knowledge of infrastructure-as-code (Terraform, Pulumi, AWS CDK, etc.)
Can communicate well, both verbally and via documentation
Have a track record of working well across teams and functions

Backend engineer,Ntropy Network,"New York, NY",30d+,$120K (Employer est.),"Over the last few decades, technological innovation has relied on democratizing some of its key ingredients: knowledge (open publishing platforms), algorithms (code repositories) and computing (cloud providers). However, the last key component, data, largely remains trapped behind barriers of regulation, privacy, schema standards and competitive risk. Enabling scalable access to data will unlock enormous value for both individual developers and companies. This has only been made possible in the last few years, through advances in manifold learning algorithms and privacy-preserving computing. See our blog for more details.

One of the most valuable kinds of data today is in the financial sector. Financial data plays a key role across many industry verticals. However, it has notoriously been locked behind regulatory barriers and a lack of format standards. Our end product is an API that makes financial transactions accessible to both humans and machine-learning models, in a scalable and privacy-preserving way.

We
- come from various fields - engineering, mathematics, physics and arts.
- are allergic to over-engineering.
- are anarchists at heart and like to hack around the status quo.
love playing board and video games.
- are radically honest and appreciate challenging one another, rather than giving out “pats on the back”. Yet, we can always rely on each other for support, feedback and results.
- are willing to learn and adapt quickly to new situations and requirements. Languages, frameworks, libraries, compilers, etc. are just tools for a job. A new problem might need a new tool. If it doesn’t exist yet, we will build it.
- have a sense of humor (well, we think we do).

As an early member of our backend engineering team, you will help
- push the limits of distributed computing and orchestrating large-scale machine learning pipelines.
- build the team and drive the direction of the company.
- shape our product and culture.
- experience the direct impact of what you build on hundreds of millions of people’s financial lives.

The following is a big plus
- fluency in Python and Rust
- experience with multi-GPU environments
- recognized open-source contributions
- participation in competitive programming events (CTFs, Putnam, IOI, IMO, IPHO, Topcoder, Codeforces, etc.)
- experience with infrastructure-as-code, cloud deployments, Kubernetes, containers

What do typical backend engineer tasks look like?
- Developing our core system and API in both Python and Rust using technologies such as PostgreSQL, ScyllaDB, Redis and ML using industry standard tools (PyTorch, Nvidia Triton).
Working with highly distributed systems that move and process large quantities of data. Reviewing and changing the architecture of these systems to improve metrics such as throughput and latency.
Understanding customer problems and designing vertical solutions on top of our core systems.
- Profiling and improving our stack by operations such as - evaluating database queries, profiling code and re-writing parts of it, or moving python code to rust.

Research Scientist in ML / NLP (All Ranks),Abridge,United States,7d,$150K - $300K (Employer est.),"Health care is all about conversations, with over 2B spoken conversations each year between patients and their care teams in just the United States. However, people forget up to 80% of those conversations, leading to worse patient outcomes. And doctors are burning out writing notes in their EMRs instead of focusing on their patients. That’s where Abridge comes in — our audio-based standalone and integrated solutions record and summarize medical conversations, anywhere care happens.
The Role
From transcribing medical conversations to delivering key takeaways, our trailblazing work in machine learning research makes the Abridge experience possible. We're currently looking to hire research scientists with experience in machine learning and natural language processing. The ideal candidate will bring technical mastery, fluency with foundation models, genuine interest in the medical domain, and strong critical thinking skills to the role. At Abridge, all of our ML work has a strong research component, and all of our research scientists contribute directly to real products that impact the lives of doctors.
What You'll Do
Advance the state of the art in medical NLP, in areas including conversation summarization, evidence extraction, outcome prediction, evaluation techniques, and experimentation.
Actively contribute to the wider research community by sharing and publishing original research

Life at Abridge
At Abridge, we’re driven by our mission to bring understanding and follow-through to every medical conversation. Our culture is founded on doing things the “inverse” way in a legacy system—focusing on patients, instead of the system; focusing on outcomes, instead of billing; and focusing on the end-user experience, instead of a hospital administrator's mandate.
Abridgers are engineers, scientists, designers, and health policy experts from a diverse set of backgrounds—an experiment in alchemy that helps us transform an industry dominated by EHRs and enterprise into a consumer-driven experience, one recording at a time. We believe in strong ideas, loosely held, and place a high premium on a growth mindset. We push each other to grow and expose each other to the latest in our respective fields. Whether it’s holding a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and helping each other be successful.
Diversity & Inclusion
Abridge is an equal opportunity employer. Diversity and inclusion is at the core of what we do. We actively welcome applicants from all backgrounds (including but not limited to race, gender, educational background, and sexual orientation).
