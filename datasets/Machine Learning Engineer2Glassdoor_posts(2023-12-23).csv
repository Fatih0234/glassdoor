Machine Learning Engineer,Ntropy Network,"New York, NY",30d+,$130K (Employer est.),"Over the last few decades, technological innovation has relied on democratizing some of its key ingredients: knowledge (open publishing platforms), algorithms (code repositories) and computing (cloud providers). However, the last key component, data, largely remains trapped behind barriers of regulation, privacy, schema standards and competitive risk. Enabling scalable access to data will unlock enormous value for both individual developers and companies. This has only been made possible in the last few years, through advances in manifold learning algorithms and privacy-preserving computing. See our blog for more details.

One of the most valuable kinds of data today is in the financial sector. Financial data plays a key role across many industry verticals. However, it has notoriously been locked behind regulatory barriers and a lack of format standards. Our end product is an API that makes financial transactions accessible to both humans and machine-learning models, in a scalable and privacy-preserving way.

This role will focus on the development of command line tools embedded in iOS and MacOS for measuring the performance of Machine Learning inference; AND the role will focus on the integration of those command line tools into Apple’s internal measurement service for on-device Machine Learning inference performance. Time is likely to be split roughly 50/50 in these two areas. For example, one challenge could be to start with layer by layer performance data from a compute backend and map it up to a higher level representation so that model authors can reason about their inference performance. Another challenge could be to leverage kernel APIs to map out all memory allocations from the inference stack and accurately report this to users. In this role you can expect to be working on a diverse and forward looking set of ML model architectures and will provide the tools and systems to understand their performance!

About the Cornell Lab of Ornithology
The Cornell Lab of Ornithology is a major, globally focused institution for research, training, and public communication relating to birds and biodiversity. The Center for Avian Population Studies (CAPS) is one of the programmatic units that carry out the Lab’s mission to interpret and conserve the earth’s biological diversity through research, education, and citizen science focused on birds. One of the major projects in CAPS is eBird, which collects information about the distribution and abundance of birds, taking advantage of the enormous popularity of watching birds to create a global network of volunteers who submit bird observations via the web to a central data repository. With this data, scientists at CAPS use machine learning and statistical methods to combine observations of birds with habitat information from satellites to make predictions of bird occurrence, abundance, and trends at a high spatiotemporal resolution. This project, known as eBird Status and Trends, represents a valuable resource for informing conservation decision making and resource management.

The Opportunity
While position responsibilities vary, every member of our community is expected to foster a culture of belonging and a psychologically healthy work environment by communicating across differences; being cooperative, collaborative, open, and welcoming; showing respect, compassion, and empathy; engaging and supporting others regardless of background or perspective; speaking up when others are being excluded or treated inappropriately; and supporting work/life integration of oneself and others.

The
ATLAS
user facility is operated by a team of approximately 30 staff members spanning groups for control systems, cryogenics, ion sources, accelerator operations, electronics, vacuum systems, and so on. The facility uses 3 ion sources, including CARIBU, and services 6 target areas by delivering heavy-ion beams at energies from ~1- 15 MeV/nucleon. In addition, the CARIBU source can deliver low-energy radioactive beams to a dedicated target area independent of the rest of the ATLAS operations. Recent selected publications enabled by the CARIBU source include:
the first direct experimental evidence of a “pear-shaped” nucleus
,
mass measurements that help us better understand how the chemical elements were produced in stellar environments
, and
study of beta decay properties of Er isotopes that explain the emerging deformation observed around nuclei with 98 neutrons

Basis (https://www.basis.ai/) is a nonprofit applied AI research organization with two mutually reinforcing goals.
The first is to understand and build intelligence. This means to establish the mathematical principles of what it means to reason, to learn, to make decisions, to understand, and to explain; and to construct software that implements these principles.
The second is to advance society’s ability to solve intractable problems. This means expanding the scale, complexity, and breadth of problems that we can solve today, and even more importantly, accelerating our ability to solve problems in the future.
To achieve these goals, we’re building both a new technological foundation that draws inspiration from how humans reason, and a new kind of collaborative organization that puts human values first.

Applied Machine Learning Engineer,Nooks,United States,30d+,$140K - $240K (Employer est.),"What is Nooks?
Nooks is a platform transforming sales reps from manual laborers to scientists. With today's technology, sales reps shouldn't need to manually write hundreds of emails, research hundreds of websites/linkedins, and make hundreds of calls. They should instead focus on the parts of their job that actually require people - talking to customers, being creative, and problem-solving. With a combination of AI tools, automation and real-time collaboration, Nooks can do the rest.
About Nooks
The team: Nooks is ~30 people. Engineering & product are mostly in SF and go to our office 2-3x/week. The go-to-market team is distributed across the U.S.
The founders (Dan, Rohan, and Nikhil) met studying AI at Stanford, have published in top AI journals, Forbes 30u30, worked at Scale AI, Tesla Autopilot, etc.
The engineering team has won international math & physics olympiads, has experience at Google, Facebook, Slack, Quora, Scale AI, Bolt, Snap, Flexport, and other fast-growing startups.
The sales team have been top-performers at companies like Gong, Amplitude, LeadIQ, and Orum.
Fundraising: we've raised ~$20M in venture capital from top-tier investors. $15M in a recent (un-announced) Series A
Fast growth: in 16 months (since June ‘22) we've grown $0 $2.5M ARR. So far in 2023 we've grown over 3x and expect to 4x by EOY.
The problem
Sales pipeline is critical for growing companies. Many, especially B2B companies, have teams of sales/business development representatives (SDR/BDRs) or full-cycle account executives whose responsibility is to identify, contact, and qualify new potential customers. There are ~750,000 SDR/BDR's in the US alone (e.g. Airtable (https://boards.greenhouse.io/airtable/jobs/6744435002), Brex (https://www.brex.com/careers/6850017002), Databricks (https://www.databricks.com/company/careers/sales-development/business-development-representative-6933516002) and many other tech companies have sizable SDR/BDR teams)
In their day-to-day, SDR/BDRs spend time on 3 main activities:
Prospecting & research - identify a list of potential customers using signals like industry, size, fundraising, headcount growth, new hires, job descriptions, etc.
Email & LinkedIn messaging - write messages to those contacts to convey the problem and pitch your product. The goal is for them to book a demo
Calling - Live phone conversations often have higher conversion than emails because they're more personal, but there's a lot more manual work involved
Most of the sales rep's job can be automated with today's technology: large language models, web scraping, automation, integrations, etc.
Nooks today

Our customers use Nooks for most of their day (avg ~3hrs/business day). Nooks currently owns end-to-end workflows around sales calls:
AI dialer - automates the manual parts of the calling process: skipping answering machines, leaving voicemails, taking notes, logging calls, even figuring out what to say on a call
Analytics - we record, transcribe, and analyze every call. Since these are all outbound calls with little context, these calls follow similar structure - opener, pitch, questions/objections, ask for meeting, etc. So we can answer questions like: “which reps struggle to book the meeting with prospects who showed interest” or “what are the most common objections across each of our key personas”
Salesfloor - sales reps & managers can work together throughout the day, listen to each others' calls, give real-time advice, coaching, shadowing, onboarding, training.
Teams that use Nooks often see a 2-3x increase in reps' productivity within weeks! And we're working on adding prospecting / research workflows (to-be-announced soon!)
(https://app.nooks.in/demoroom)
The role
Note: Exact job title will be commensurate with experience
We have an ambitious product vision in a nascent area - AI-powered realtime collaboration - so there are a ton of interesting technical challenges on our roadmap. We're hiring our first Machine Learning Engineer. This is a role focused on implementing ML features into Nooks. Our ideal candidate will have prior experience working in industry for a business where ML is a core part of the offering.
Responsibilities will include training production models to improve their accuracy for specific sales use cases. You will align our technical strategy with performance, cost and feasibility considerations.
Examples of engineering problems you may touch
These are just examples, this list is non-exhaustive, and you definitely don't need experience in all of these areas. But hopefully you find some of them exciting!
Realtime audio AI & precision/recall/latency tradeoffs (algorithms & models)
We use audio data, transcription, silence detection, and several other signals to detect whether a live phone call is a voicemail, a human, or a dial tree. Here, latency is a third factor added to the standard precision/recall tradeoff because it's important we can detect humans quickly. Our approach involves LLM embeddings, few-shot learning, data labeling, and continuous monitoring of model performance in prod.
Smart call funnels & playbooks (data wrangling, backend eng, GPT-3, UX)
At what point in the conversation do my reps get stuck? What are the toughest questions that we need to address? Can I “program” a playbook so that Nooks will help my team standardize toward best-practices? We're using GPT-3 and other LLM's to turn companies' mostly unstructured call data into actionable strategies & feedback loops.
Conversation embeddings & markov models (ML modeling)
What does the anatomy of a call look like? If I say XYZ, what are the different ways the prospect might answer and the probabilities of each? Conditioned on the first half of the call, what do I say next to maximize the likelihood that I book a demo at the end of the call? Can we use LLM's to generate embeddings of conversations that we can use to cluster similar conversation patterns and predict where the conversation is headed?
Requirements
Bachelor's or Master's degree in Computer Science, Machine Learning, Data Science, or a related field.
3+ years of industry experience, including 2+ years training and deploying ML models in production.
Full stack ML Eng chops: proficiency in general purposes programming languages such as Python/Javascript, and with libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, scikit-learn etc.
Expertise in areas like NLP, Deep Learning, Anomaly Detection, Transformers and Large Language Models.
Nice to haves:
Background in an analytical field like heuristics, data science &/or statistics
Prior experiences working in both startup and research environments
We offer competitive compensation because we want to hire the best people and reward them for their contributions to our mission. We pay all employees competitively relative to market.

A day in the life with the Intelligent Systems Group
Our projects lie at the interface between fundamental research and engineering, and we are often adapting ideas from disparate academic fields and finding ways to apply them in various real-world domains. We have several R&D projects running in parallel, and work focus shifts according to different project needs and deadlines. Each project is coordinated by one of our Principal Investigators (PI) who are responsible for supervising and delegating workloads between projects and it is common for scientists, engineers, and analysists to be involved in two to three projects simultaneously. You will start off working on individual tasks and filling in singular needs but over time be given responsibility for developing and maintaining larger pieces of projects and owning your own systems. We encourage our group members' growth and provide opportunities for taking on more responsibility, eventually leading projects and deciding the direction of future research.
Our projects leverage the following core disciplines:
Computer Vision, Image Processing, and Numerical Methods
Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing
Simulation, 3D Modeling, and Image Synthesis
Remote Sensing and Geospatial Analytics
State Estimation, Filtering, and Statistical Analysis
Data Acquisition, Synthesis, Wrangling, and Processing
Software Development and Sys Admin
Research, Proposal Writing, Grantsmanship, and Business Development
Even though you will start off focusing on one specific domain, team members are frequently involved on multiple projects with duties that span across these core disciplines. It is perfectly acceptable if find yourself slowly branching out or changing disciplines as your interests change and certain projects gain more traction than others. Branching out takes the form of joining existing projects or working on proposals to start new ones. Each of us is involved to some degree with the evaluation of government-released research solicitations. When batches of solicitations are released by various government entities, like NASA or the Department of Defense, for example, we come together as a team and decide on which ones we should pursue and who will lead efforts on writing proposals to the selected topics.

Interview Process
After applicants have submitted their application, our interviews follow a four-step process:
Pre-screening and request for work sample. If an applicant's resume passes pre-screening, Lynntech will send out a candidate packet which contains information about the company and the team. We will also request a work sample which is demonstrative of the applicant's experience relevant to the job posting. If the work sample demonstrates relevant proficiency in the job domain, Lynntech will continue with scheduling a time for an interview.

Research Scientist in ML / NLP (All Ranks),Abridge,United States,7d,$150K - $300K (Employer est.),"Health care is all about conversations, with over 2B spoken conversations each year between patients and their care teams in just the United States. However, people forget up to 80% of those conversations, leading to worse patient outcomes. And doctors are burning out writing notes in their EMRs instead of focusing on their patients. That’s where Abridge comes in — our audio-based standalone and integrated solutions record and summarize medical conversations, anywhere care happens.
The Role
From transcribing medical conversations to delivering key takeaways, our trailblazing work in machine learning research makes the Abridge experience possible. We're currently looking to hire research scientists with experience in machine learning and natural language processing. The ideal candidate will bring technical mastery, fluency with foundation models, genuine interest in the medical domain, and strong critical thinking skills to the role. At Abridge, all of our ML work has a strong research component, and all of our research scientists contribute directly to real products that impact the lives of doctors.
What You'll Do
Advance the state of the art in medical NLP, in areas including conversation summarization, evidence extraction, outcome prediction, evaluation techniques, and experimentation.
Actively contribute to the wider research community by sharing and publishing original research
Help to define important problems, identify appropriate baselines, develop state-of-the-art methods, and ship them into production.
Dial deeply into real-time feedback from clinicians to guide further refinements and innovations

Life at Abridge
At Abridge, we’re driven by our mission to bring understanding and follow-through to every medical conversation. Our culture is founded on doing things the “inverse” way in a legacy system—focusing on patients, instead of the system; focusing on outcomes, instead of billing; and focusing on the end-user experience, instead of a hospital administrator's mandate.
Abridgers are engineers, scientists, designers, and health policy experts from a diverse set of backgrounds—an experiment in alchemy that helps us transform an industry dominated by EHRs and enterprise into a consumer-driven experience, one recording at a time. We believe in strong ideas, loosely held, and place a high premium on a growth mindset. We push each other to grow and expose each other to the latest in our respective fields. Whether it’s holding a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and helping each other be successful.
Diversity & Inclusion
Abridge is an equal opportunity employer. Diversity and inclusion is at the core of what we do. We actively welcome applicants from all backgrounds (including but not limited to race, gender, educational background, and sexual orientation).
