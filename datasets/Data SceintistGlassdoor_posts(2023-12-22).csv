Staff Applied Scientist - Forecasting,Afresh,Remote,14d,,"Afresh is on a mission to eliminate food waste and make fresh food accessible to all. Our first A.I.-powered solution optimizes ordering, forecasting, and store operations for fresh food departments in brick-and-mortar grocers. With our Fresh Operating System, regional and national grocery retailers have placed $1.6 billion in produce orders across the US and we've helped our partners prevent 34 million pounds of food from going to waste. Working at Afresh represents a one-of-a-kind opportunity to have massive social impact at scale by leveraging uncommonly impactful software – we hope you'll join us!
About the Role
The Prediction, Optimization, and Planning (POP) team builds Afresh's core replenishment technology. Our AI models are directly responsible for ordering millions of dollars of fresh inventory across the world every day. Fresh food ordering is an extremely complex high-dimensional decision-making problem. We face the complex challenges presented by decaying product, uncertain shelf lives, varying consumer demand, stochastic arrival times, extreme weather events, and tight performance constraints (to name a few). We tackle these problems with a mix of machine learning, large-scale simulation, and optimization technologies. Our team has presented work at multiple industry leading conferences, and we encourage team members to write and present their work publicly.
As an Applied Scientist at Afresh focused on forecasting, you will take your existing knowledge of machine learning and apply it to the challenge of demand forecasting. You will thrive in this role if you love the craft of neural networks in research and production environments: hyperparameter optimization, model tuning, feature selection, thorough error analysis, architecture selection, and deep understanding of the data you are modeling. We are looking for someone who is equally adept at gaining insights from 8 hours of data analysis or 8 hours of reading papers.
Your will research, implement, and rigorously validate improvements to our core forecasting system. This will include modeling seasonal demand, rare events, promotion cannibalization, and aggregating correlated demand across multi-echelon systems. Your work will be visible from day one, will make a substantial impact on decreasing food waste, and will lead to fresher, healthier produce for millions of people across the world.
You will work on improving the accuracy and calibration of the demand forecasting models that power our warehouse-level and store-level ordering products. You will also lead research development for new product and business challenges.
In your first 3 months, you will acquire a comprehensive understanding of our current forecasting system and modern neural network approaches to time-series forecasting. You will gain proficiency in our data manipulation, transformation, and forecasting tools, and you'll test an experimental improvement to our demand forecasting system.
By the end of your first 6 months, you will have proposed, implemented, and rigorously validated an improvement to our forecasting system.
By the end of your first year, you will have led the implementation of fundamental changes to our core forecasting system and led research into forecasting extensions (multi-echelon forecasting, rare event modeling).
We need to make optimal ordering decisions for millions of items for weeks at a time, and our system must be fault-tolerant to an extreme. Our partners rely on our system to order millions of dollars of inventory every week, and so your code must be rigorously validated, tested, and bug-proof.
Skills and Experience
5+ years of industrial or academic experience building mission-critical machine learning systems.
Excellent communication and presentation skills. You should be able to explain complex mathematical ideas to product teams in plain English.
5+ years of experience in neural network libraries (Pytorch/Tensorflow/JAX). Proficiency in Pytorch preferred, or willingness to transition from Tensorflow/JAX.
Fluent in programmatic data analysis using SQL and Pandas.
Excellent data visualization skills.

About Afresh

Data Scientist (Multiple Levels),Red Alpha LLC,"Annapolis Junction, MD",30d+,$88K - $127K (Glassdoor est.),"Description:

A little about us:
The Red Alpha Data Science practice grew out of Red Alpha's reputation in Software and System Engineering with our Department of Defense clients. As sometimes happens, customers who trust our expertise in adjacent areas asked Red Alpha to assist with some of their burgeoning Data Science problems.
Culturally, it probably suffices to say that we take our work seriously, but not ourselves. Our leaders have spent time in the trenches and have cursed daylight savings time changes and trailing whitespace as many times as you have. We like to say that we spend 80% of our time cleaning the data...and 20% of our time complaining about cleaning the data. Joking aside, our voices matter, and it is easy to see how our decisions affect the Data Science practice and Red Alpha as a whole. We have a clear vision of where we are headed.
Our team takes a pragmatic approach to Data Science, defining it loosely as the intersection of technical expertise, business acumen, and soft skills to solve business problems with data. We spend a lot of time trying to understand the problem before we set about building a solution, and we prefer lower tech useful solutions over shiny algorithms and dust on the shelf. Did we mention we’re pragmatic? We have a diverse set of skills across our team, and whether you are a traditional Data Scientist (whatever that means…), an Applied Research Mathematician, a Database Engineer, a Full Stack Developer, or something else in that neighborhood, if you have a knack for picking apart data to make sense of it, we would enjoy having a conversation with you.
A day in the life:
You’ll likely start your day at a customer location near our Red Alpha offices, checking to see if there are any important items that have just come up. If not, you’ll move on to improving a dashboard or other data product that you’re responsible for, or perhaps produce a weekly output the customer is expecting. You’ll be using R or Python a lot, but also Git, Mongo, some commercial software and several other usual suspects. Once a week you’ll attend a team meeting (with 4 others) to prioritize things, and you’ll have a lot of interaction with the team otherwise, typically several times per day. You’ll need your sense of humor and need to be willing to leave your ego at the door.
Requirements:

What you bring to the table:
Now on to the fun of formal requirements - we have to apologize in advance for the corporate-speak here, but just hold your breath for a few lines and everything will be okay. We are actively hiring data professionals for roles across a broad range of skill levels and projects. Our goal is to find the best fit for you so please note that if you apply to one of them and we see a fit elsewhere we will let you know. So do not worry about applying initially for every position you might be interested in.
All of our data scientists need the following skills:
Proficiency with a scripting language such as R or Python
Experience with data science techniques and algorithms such as classification, clustering, random forests, deterministic forests (jk), hierarchical modeling, deep learning, Markov Chain Monte Carlo, and others. Note that you do not need to have all of these (we hope you enjoyed our random smattering of techniques…!) but you should be comfortable and capable with several of them and know some others not on this list.
A B.S. Degree in Data Science, Mathematics, Computer Science or related field.
For entry-level data scientists, 0-3 years of experience on Data Science projects.
For mid-level data scientists, 3-6 years of experience on Data Science projects.
For senior-level data scientists, at least 6 years of experience on Data Science projects with at least 3 years of experience managing teams.
A TS/SCI with Polygraph security clearance.
These are important skills to have, but not necessarily mandatory:
Exceptional interpersonal skills. You know, as in you might not be at the top of the list to be a game show host but you do like people and enjoy solving problems jointly with your colleagues.
Experience with Java, C, or other compiled languages
Comprehensive knowledge of Saturday Night Live sketches (just kidding)
Experience with SQL/NoSQL, Spark, Hadoop
Familiarity with Javascript and Scripting
Familiarity with Docker, GitLab, and React
Why Red Alpha?
Every day, our elite customers are pushing through ""the grind"" to defeat the enemy, even putting their lives on the line for our freedom.

Extreme Ownership - We are responsible for the results to our clients, teammates, and shareholders. We own everything in our domain that affects these results.
Boldness - Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Thinking big inspire results. We would rather fail at the meaningful than succeed at the trivial.
Ruthless Prioritization - We want to do more than we possibly can. We must be disciplined on how to use our precious money, people, and time. That means saying no to a lot of good ideas so we can focus on the most important thing.
Integrity - We do the right thing. This trust must never be broken.
Effectiveness - We do what's needed to deliver the intended results. Whether that requires disciplined process or scrappy implementation, we find a way.
Team Oriented - We work collaboratively to achieve more. We respect, trust, and support one another.
Transparency - We use simple and clear communication to share information so that people have the context to make good decisions.
Make Forward Progress - Something is better than nothing. We make incremental improvements on our path towards perfection. Crawl, walk, run, and then sprint.
Resiliency - We understand that any big goal comes with ambiguity, change, and setbacks. We adapt and keep going.

Important Notice:
At Integra Connect, we are committed to providing a safe and secure environment for our job applicants. Unfortunately, scammers may attempt to impersonate our company to deceive individuals seeking employment. We take this matter seriously and want to ensure your job search with us is free from any fraudulent activity.
Integra Connect has become aware of recent, fraudulent recruitment activity being conducted by individuals or groups who claim to be third party recruiters and/or points of contact for our Company. Examples include sending candidates a request for personal information, conducting online interviews or meetings, making offers of employment, demanding money for employment related services and activities, or asking the applicant to purchase a laptop or other work-related equipment for the job. The aim of the fraud is to obtain personally identifying information (e.g., identity theft) and/or money. The Company’s name, as well as the names of employees, are used to try to convey authenticity.
Here are some tips to help you identify and avoid job scams:
1. Always Check the Source:
Ensure that the job listing is on our official website or a reputable job board. Our official domain is https://www.integraconnect.com/resources/careers/. Be cautious of unsolicited emails, text messages, or social media messages offering job opportunities.
2. Be Wary of Requests for Personal Information:
We will never request sensitive personal information like your Social Security number, bank details, or payment for onboarding/equipment. If you encounter such requests, it's likely a scam.
3. Verify Contact Information:
Check that the contact information provided in the job posting, including email addresses and phone numbers, aligns with our official contact information. Scammers often use generic or non-company email addresses.
What is the sender’s email address? Is it consistent with other job postings from this company? Email addresses that are slightly different from any business’s primary contact information (“Jane.Doe@IntegraConnect.org” vs “John.Doe@Integra Connect.com”) are a common warning sign.
If you are contacted through LinkedIn, be sure to review the entire profile to verify their credentials.
If you suspect that a job offer is fraudulent, we recommend that you do not respond to it.
If you believe you are the victim of any fraudulent activity, you can report it to the appropriate authorities at https://www.myfloridalegal.com/consumer-protection/how-to-protect-yourself-job-listing-and-job-search-firms (Florida Department of State) and/or https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/job-scams#report (U.S. Federal Trade Commission).
Integra Connect is not responsible for any fraudulent offers and advises prospective candidates to follow the guidance provided above.

Data scientist,Ntropy Network,"New York, NY",30d+,$130K (Employer est.),"Over the last few decades, technological innovation has relied on democratizing some of its key ingredients: knowledge (open publishing platforms), algorithms (code repositories) and computing (cloud providers). However, the last key component, data, largely remains trapped behind barriers of regulation, privacy, schema standards and competitive risk. Enabling scalable access to data will unlock enormous value for both individual developers and companies. This has only been made possible in the last few years, through advances in manifold learning algorithms and privacy-preserving computing. See our blog for more details.

One of the most valuable kinds of data today is in the financial sector. Financial data plays a key role across many industry verticals. However, it has notoriously been locked behind regulatory barriers and a lack of format standards. Our end product is an API that makes financial transactions accessible to both humans and machine-learning models, in a scalable and privacy-preserving way.

We
- come from various fields - engineering, mathematics, physics and arts.
- are allergic to over-engineering.
- are anarchists at heart and like to hack around the status quo.
love playing board and video games.
- are radically honest and appreciate challenging one another, rather than giving out “pats on the back”. Yet, we can always rely on each other for support, feedback and results.
- are willing to learn and adapt quickly to new situations and requirements. Languages, frameworks, libraries, compilers, etc. are just tools for a job. A new problem might need a new tool. If it doesn’t exist yet, we will build it.
- have a sense of humor (well, we think we do).

As an early member of our data science team, you will help
- push the limits of what can be done with data.
- build the team and drive the direction of the company.
- shape our product and culture.
- experience the direct impact of what you build on hundreds of millions of people’s financial lives.

The following are required
- the tools: Python, Pandas / Polars, Matplotlib, sklearn, etc.
SQL and fundamental database operations.
- recognized open-source contributions and/or top performance in data competitions (Kaggle, Numerai, etc.).
fluency in statistics and probability.

Data Scientist,Milu Health,Remote,30d+,,"WE MAKE HEALTHCARE AFFORDABLE FOR AMERICANS
Today, 112 million Americans have trouble paying for healthcare. Nearly 1 in 4 Americans have medical debt. Healthcare costs are skyrocketing, and patients are facing more of that financial burden. We started Milu Health to tackle this problem.


WHO WE ARE
Milu Health is an early stage startup focused on making healthcare affordable for Americans.

Using healthcare pricing data - a 500TB healthcare cost dataset that payers recently have had to release publicly for the first time ever - combined with other healthcare quality and claims data, we think we can change how employers and employees pay for healthcare and ultimately make high-quality medical care more affordable for patients.

Our tools comprise an operating system to reduce a patient's personal healthcare spend - from helping patients identify which high-quality and high-value doctors to go to for a procedure, to informing them about the most affordable prescription options for their medicines, to making sure their medical bills are correct. Through our entire stack, we engage patients through our consumer-facing products and cash-back incentives that can cover their out-of-pocket spend.

We're looking for the best people in the world to dig and build something great with us. It's not going to be easy. There's going to be twists and turns, successes and failures, and tons of learning. But we're in this for the long haul and believe we can fundamentally change a broken system.

Our founding team has spent the last combined 10 years building data-based healthcare businesses. Milu is backed by leading investors including a16z, Box Group, Steve Pagliuca, 81 Collection, Starting Line VC, Hypothesis Ventures and others.

THE ROLE
We're looking for a Data Scientist to join our team in our New York City or Evanston offices, or work remotely. As that data scientist, you will be responsible for the design and development of modules, pipelines and algorithms across all of our products, ultimately aimed at identifying cost savings opportunities and high quality medical options for patients. You will drive the scaleable analysis of data in a HIPAA-compliant environment. Ideally, you've previously done extensive healthcare claims data analysis and have experience working with CPT codes and other healthcare cost data. Most importantly, you're going to be an early data scientist on a growing team. You'll set our processes, culture and build the core infrastructure in the earliest days of the company. It's going to be a fun ride.

WHY WE'RE LOOKING FOR YOU

5-10 years of data science / data analysis experience, 3-5 years in healthcare
You've worked in agile environments and are comfortable iterating quickly
You're excited to work at a startup: things will change fast, we'll learn quickly, build, iterate and evolve",4.0,Size1 to 50 Employees,Founded--,TypeContract,Industry--,Sector--,RevenueUnknown / Non-Applicable

Westfield, a leading provider of commercial insurance, established 1848 Ventures in 2018 to lead the company’s efforts to expand beyond conventional insurance by understanding and addressing the broader risks that customers face. We deliver tangible customer growth and financial results by developing and monetizing a portfolio of customer-centered innovations, which may or may not involve insurance, but are consistent with Westfield’s brand and reinforce our right to win in various markets.

Communicate effectively. Taking your project from business problem to production service isn't a solo exercise; you'll need to work well with people from other teams and our own in order to succeed.
Improve the team. Everyone is responsible for making the team better: as a Sr. Data Scientist, you'll have an informal mentorship role by way of things like pair programming and providing meaningful code reviews.

Consultant - Middle East Crisis Analysis Data Scientist and Front End Developer - Remote,Mercy Corps,United States,2d,,"Background:
Mercy Corps is a leading global organization powered by the belief that a better world is possible. In disaster, in hardship, in more than 40 countries around the world, we partner to put bold solutions into action — helping people triumph over adversity and build stronger communities from within.
Over the past eight years, Mercy Corps has established a reputation for quality and timely data and analysis through its network of Crisis Analysis teams. Through Crisis Analysis, the agency has carved out a niche among information providers in the humanitarian and development space, owing to the granularity, reactivity and holistic approach of our products, which focus on some of the most hard-to-reach, data-poor and complex contexts requiring assistance. This is underpinned by Mercy Corps’ status as an operational INGO, which ensures that analysis products are practicable and relevant for humanitarian actors.
Purpose / Project Description:
The Middle East Regional Data Analysis Hub (MERDAH) is a platform where quantitative indicators developed by ME Crisis Analysis teams can be accessed, analyzed, and downloaded. The dashboard aims to show MC's capacity to develop timely and relevant quantitative analysis in the ME region and for other peers and external stakeholders to use, and to eventually serve several key objectives/purposes as part of our evidence-driven commitment. Dashboard modules are regionally cross-cutting by theme or approach; for example, agriculture analysis (theme) or price predictions (approach). The MERDAH currently covers Syria, Iraq, Palestine, Lebanon, and Yemen. The MERDAH will also host the drought and flooding anticipatory action modules produced for the ECHO-funded MEACAM project.
The platform allows users to freely download quantitative indicators useful for targeting (Operational actors; Peer agencies) to identify the most vulnerable locations for interventions and advocacy & influence (donors; local/national Governments; media), which are not immediately operational but useful for understanding the context to improve decision-making. For example, Mercy Corps LCAT developed an economic vulnerability indicator using night lights satellite imagery the Lebanon country team used to target cadasters for a MPCA program. The CA-SYR team used satellite imagery to measure the effect of the second-consecutive drought in northeast Syria to highlight the scale and intensity of the repercussions on farmers, the results of which were featured in a NES Forum publication advocating for funding to alleviate the situation.
The continual enhancement of the MERDAH is necessary to obtain and maintain a high level of relevance and utility to the community, and serve as an attraction to donors. Further, timely additions to the MERDAH ensures that Mercy Corps is the “first to market” to deliver actionable spatial and quantitative analysis to the humanitarian community.
Consultant Objective:
A front-end developer, in collaboration with technical support and close coordination with the Regional Data Analysis Specialist and the CA-SYR Director, Yemen CA Team Lead, and Lebanon CA Team Lead will need to produce the following for the MERDAH:

"Senior Data Scientist, Clinical Signals",Pearl Health,"New York, NY",9d,$130K - $170K (Employer est.),"Who we are. . .
Pearl Health is restoring the independence and joy of practicing medicine for doctors in the United States. Our healthcare system has burdened our doctors with too much process, while removing them from what they do best: caring for those we love most. We are a team of physicians and public health experts (Stanford, Dartmouth, Harvard, Mass. General), technologists (athenahealth, Apple, Amazon, Meta, Flatiron, WalMart Health), healthcare innovators (Oscar, Aledade, VillageMD, Stellar, Arcadia) and experienced risk management professionals (CVS/Aetna, Humana, Cigna, United) who believe that primary care providers (PCPs) are the key to the United States' future health. Pearl recently announced a strategic partnership to proliferate value-based care with Walgreens, one of the largest healthcare companies in the country. Our investors include Andreessen Horowitz, Viking Global Investors, AlleyCorp, and SV Angel.
Pearl Health helps PCPs who are overwhelmed by the demands of an aging population and the unpredictable business model inherent to Traditional Medicare. Over time, our solution will empower PCPs to provide better care to their entire patient population. We believe there is a need to bring humanism back to healthcare by giving physicians the ability to better allocate their time with patients, increasing their autonomy, creating incentives that are aligned with achieving better outcomes through clinical decision-making powered by actionable intelligence, and making risk sharing more available and readily optimized through an intelligent marketplace. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) is launching a new value-based care program to disrupt Traditional Medicare, and we believe that this represents an opportunity to achieve the meaningful change we envision.

What we hope you can do. . .
We are seeking a brilliant Senior Data Scientist with a track record of propelling business strategies through analytical insights and algorithmic systems. Your work will be a core asset of our company, allowing us to provide better care to our members by identifying opportunities to prevent unnecessary medical spend and improve patient care management. You should be a strategic and analytical thinker, an effective communicator, an expert in analytical and data infrastructure systems, and comfortable performing sophisticated modeling exercises independently. We are looking for experts in both causal inference and machine learning, so you should have a deep familiarity with and passion for these technologies. We are building a best-in-class patient management platform so that physicians can better prioritize care. For more information, see our white paper on the Signal-Action Framework.
What a Senior Data Scientist means to us...
Translate the company's goals and vision into its strategy and operations by conducting sophisticated quantitative analyses while informing decisions about our infrastructure and approach.
Help us change the future of work for doctors in America by applying state of the art technology solutions, including machine learning and causal inference.
Develop and deploy sophisticated algorithmic approaches to prioritizing patient care in a clinical setting.
Measure the causal impact of interventions, including regression, multilevel modeling, propensity score matching, difference-in-differences, and regression discontinuity designs.
Partner effectively with Engineering, Product, Clinical Operations, Analytics, and Client Performance teams toward best-in-class analytics systems to give our physician partners insight into their patient panels.
Support the technology needs of various departments by creating a data-literate ecosystem.
Who you are…
Degree in statistics, applied math, computer science, engineering or a related field and/or 8+ years of experience in performing results-driven quantitative analysis in a collaborative environment.
SQL expertise and strong foundation in at least one of the main data science programming languages (Python, R, Julia, Scala, matlab). Python is our current primary language and is preferred.
A proven ability to conduct research and empower data-driven aspects of our product through a mix of internal resources and external vendors, especially in ML domains.
Experience collaborating with data engineering and analytics teams to define needs for an ETL pipeline. Familiarity with dbt preferred, but open to additional cloud ETL tools.
Thoughtful collaborator, able to manage multiple demanding stakeholders, assimilate complex information quickly, and scope work in a way that balances deep insight and fast turnaround.
Prior experience working with healthcare data in any part of the industry (payor, provider, pharmacy, etc.); familiarity with population health data is preferred but not essential.
Experience mentoring and collaborating with data scientists, data analysts, and data engineers to create a well-rounded data culture. Experience providing feedback on data science methods and approaches in related workstreams, and experience presenting your work and core competencies to a broader data team.

Research Scientist in ML / NLP (All Ranks),Abridge,United States,6d,$150K - $300K (Employer est.),"Health care is all about conversations, with over 2B spoken conversations each year between patients and their care teams in just the United States. However, people forget up to 80% of those conversations, leading to worse patient outcomes. And doctors are burning out writing notes in their EMRs instead of focusing on their patients. That’s where Abridge comes in — our audio-based standalone and integrated solutions record and summarize medical conversations, anywhere care happens.
The Role
From transcribing medical conversations to delivering key takeaways, our trailblazing work in machine learning research makes the Abridge experience possible. We're currently looking to hire research scientists with experience in machine learning and natural language processing. The ideal candidate will bring technical mastery, fluency with foundation models, genuine interest in the medical domain, and strong critical thinking skills to the role. At Abridge, all of our ML work has a strong research component, and all of our research scientists contribute directly to real products that impact the lives of doctors.
What You'll Do
Advance the state of the art in medical NLP, in areas including conversation summarization, evidence extraction, outcome prediction, evaluation techniques, and experimentation.
Actively contribute to the wider research community by sharing and publishing original research
Help to define important problems, identify appropriate baselines, develop state-of-the-art methods, and ship them into production.
Dial deeply into real-time feedback from clinicians to guide further refinements and innovations
Be results-oriented in the face of ambiguous problems and uncertain outcomes
What You'll Bring
Strong research background, as demonstrated through papers and a graduate degree (MS or PhD) in Electrical Engineering, Computer Sciences, Mathematics, or equivalent experience.
High-impact publications at peer-reviewed AI conferences (e.g. *CL, NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR).

Life at Abridge
At Abridge, we’re driven by our mission to bring understanding and follow-through to every medical conversation. Our culture is founded on doing things the “inverse” way in a legacy system—focusing on patients, instead of the system; focusing on outcomes, instead of billing; and focusing on the end-user experience, instead of a hospital administrator's mandate.
Abridgers are engineers, scientists, designers, and health policy experts from a diverse set of backgrounds—an experiment in alchemy that helps us transform an industry dominated by EHRs and enterprise into a consumer-driven experience, one recording at a time. We believe in strong ideas, loosely held, and place a high premium on a growth mindset. We push each other to grow and expose each other to the latest in our respective fields. Whether it’s holding a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and helping each other be successful.
Diversity & Inclusion
Abridge is an equal opportunity employer. Diversity and inclusion is at the core of what we do. We actively welcome applicants from all backgrounds (including but not limited to race, gender, educational background, and sexual orientation).
Staying Safe - Protect Yourself From Recruitment Fraud

Members can play, pause and resume watching as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, and can change their plans at any time.

Everything that we build to delight our members, and all of the work we do to figure out how to do that better, relies on our extensive infrastructure, which spans what we rent from AWS to what we build ourselves (we operate our own custom-built content delivery network, Open Connect).

The Security, Platform and Open Connect Data Science and Engineering team partners with engineering teams across Netflix. Our goal is to use a data driven lens to enhance Netflix’s foundational technical infrastructure. We help design experiments, run analyses, productionize new data sources, and build analytic tooling that helps our partners innovate and build more performant, efficient and reliable systems.

We are seeking a Data Scientist who can help with foundational measurement problems in the infrastructure space. Our infrastructure is big and complex, and traditional approaches, such as member randomized A/B tests, are not always possible. This is an opportunity to partner with a cross-functional team to design, analyze, and build and enhance reusable tooling for our engineering partners. Experimentation techniques are critical to the long-term performance, cost management and reliability of our infrastructure, and you will be a key contributor in this area for Netflix.

Build a rapport with engineering stakeholders by thoroughly understanding their domain and supporting them in designing, executing and analyzing experiments.
Partner with other data scientists on the team, and with data scientists and engineers in the Experimentation Platform organization, to design and build scalable, self-serve experimentation tooling to meet infrastructure engineering needs.
Design and rigorously validate new A/B testing methods and quasi-experiments.
Be an advocate for the infrastructure experimentation space by thoroughly documenting your work, creating educational content, and exploring new ways to create more visibility for infrastructure experimentation across Netflix.
Execute and present strong analysis and insights, share your work proactively and consistently seek feedback to refine your approach.

You Are
Fascinated by understanding how complex systems work, but pragmatic in your solutions to experimentation problems on those systems.
An impact-oriented, applied scientist. You know the theory behind experimentation but are motivated most by how the theory is used in practice.
A great practitioner with a solid understanding of statistics.
A good coder who likes to work with python, SQL (Trino, Spark SQL), and/or PySpark
Comfortable with ambiguity and capable of navigating complex stakeholder relationships.
Able to communicate your ideas clearly and succinctly with the right amount of detail to audiences with varying technical backgrounds.
Culture
Netflix's culture is key to our success. We celebrate diversity, recognizing that diversity of thought and background builds stronger teams, and we approach inclusion equally seriously and thoughtfully. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.

Our compensation structure consists solely of an annual salary; we do not have bonuses. You choose each year how much of your compensation you want in salary versus stock options. To determine your personal top of market compensation, we rely on market indicators and consider your specific job family, background, skills, and experience to determine your compensation in the market range.

Description
The NASA Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, and ocean Ecosystem (PACE) mission, slated for launch in 2022, will extend and improve NASA’s 20+ year record of satellite observations of global ocean biology, aerosols, and clouds. Designed and built at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), PACE will include the Ocean Color Instrument (OCI), an imaging spectrometer with sensitivity from the ultraviolet (UV) to near infrared (NIR), plus several discrete shortwave infrared bands. PACE will also have two contributed multi-angle polarimeters (MAPs), which maximize observed information about the earth’s atmosphere and ocean. Another upcoming mission is the Geostationary Littoral Imaging and Monitoring Radiometer (GLIMR), a NASA Earth Venture class hyperspectral imager devoted to coastal remote sensing from geostationary orbit.
Scientific data processing for these instruments will be performed in the NASA GSFC Ocean Ecology Laboratory (OEL), which has a long history of ocean color science data processing for instruments such as the Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor (SeaWiFS), the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP). However, the hyperspectral, multi-angle, polarimetric and geostationary nature of the PACE and GLIMR missions means that the data volume will be significantly larger than in the past, and more sophisticated data analysis approaches will likely be needed in order to fully exploit these new datasets. In recognition of this challenge, NASA seeks a post-doctoral fellow with the appropriate data science skills to develop new methods of analysis, processing or otherwise.
Examples of areas of interest include:
deep learning for forward/inverse modeling
probabilistic programming
statistical analysis and inference methods
cloud computing
data reduction and mining methods
problem solving and algorithm design of complex systems using optimization methods
Candidates need not have a strong background in oceanography or atmospheric science to apply, although an interest in, and ability to understand the underlying problems is important. The role of the candidate is to seek new solutions to established problems in close collaboration with PACE domain specialists and implement them at scale. Candidates must have experience or training in one or more of the following skill sets as they apply to large datasets:
data science
computer science
statistics
artificial intelligence

Our Approach to Flexible Work

With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.
Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Data Scientist,AE Studio,"Los Angeles, CA",30d+,$120K - $220K (Employer est.),"AE Studio is an LA-based company focused on increasing human agency while maintaining our ineffable culture and whimsy. If the work diminishes agency, we may simply decide to “eff” it after all. In our Venice CA office and our respective domiciles live a team of highly-skilled developers, data scientists, and dubiously-lucid humorists building agency-increasing products you may recall from such sentences as the one in this paragraph. We’ve worked with Samsung, Walmart, Berkshire Hathaway, and other large, important entities you’ve probably heard of. Our work environment is fantastic for aspiring coders, calculators, and entrepreneurs. Also, we have neither VC, nor PE, nor other acronyms funding us. We have a weird business model where we sell our work for a profit and use those profits to pay people (I told you it was weird!).
More specifically, we deploy the proceeds from our consulting work in development and data science and our skunkworks proceeds to support research into cause areas we think are of paramount interest to human beings. We have made a name for ourselves in cutting-edge brain computer interface (BCI) R&D, and now we want to replicate past successes and solve the problem of AI alignment (aligning future powerful systems with human best interests). We want to optimize for human agency, if you feel similarly, please to support our research efforts. Data scientists will have the opportunity between client projects to work on important alignment research, with the opportunity to potentially have your research project prioritized if particularly promising.
Do you have strong problem-solving skills? Do you have a disposition suited for self-management? Have you ever composed a Gilbert and Sullivan parody that would offend Victorian sensibilities? If you can say “yes” to two of those three questions, please !
ABOUT YOU
Fluency in Python–used often, derided occasionally, and considered its eponymous reference to the best of British sketch comedy
Proven data science experience–primary or equal contributor, multiple smaller projects, management of steak-holders (so projects come out ‘well-done’)
Comfort with the statistics and methods deployed in classification problems–that is, the ability to see the random forest for the trees
Familiarity with NLP/NLU–even if this posting’s language is a bit unnatural, we suspect you’ll understand our process
Experience calling machine learning APIs via REST or client libraries - and determining that their responses lack wit, guile, and tact
Agile experience (worked with Kanban, Scrum, Extreme Programming)–or a sound literary understanding of Steve Martin’s “Picasso at the Lapin Agile,” even if you don’t speak French
Growth mindset – You had better be funnier after the first 90 days...
Willingness to learn our systems (wait, we have systems?)
Full-time availability–but if you have cool side projects that increase human agency, we totally want you to keep working on it...we’ll even help!
Demonstrated ability to work independently/autonomously
Ability to communicate effectively and work exclusively in English. This is a must, our ability to crack jokes in other languages is decidedly de rigeur...
BONUS POINTS FOR
Experience with self-managed data science projects–show us your cool side hustles, especially if they increase human agency or include obscure references!
Software development background - We need help with syntax in English too...
Experience working with / building / training deep learning-based computer vision or NLP models or LLMs – extra double-secret bonus points for identifying Schroedinger’s cat in a video
JavaScript / Node.js experience–require(‘sense of humor’)
Clean Code, Unit Tests, Lather, Rinse, Repeat
Experience managing clients and client relationships–because, y’know, they pay us...

You care about AI alignment, and are optimistic in humanity’s capacity to problem solve and safely navigate accelerating AI capabilities and have an awesome future
Equity
Working at AE means receiving equity in some of our client projects and in the Skunkworks projects we incubate. The equity granted is priced at a value of $0 when you receive it. If it were otherwise, you’d be forced to pay taxes. But to be clear, there are no free lunches, only the choice of who pays for your sandwich.
At AE, the equity you receive is not free to AE. We invest millions annually in Skunkworks projects - paying our employees to build technology for which no client pays a bill. We receive equity from certain clients, which means we accept less in terms of our billable rate. We then pass that equity on to our employees. Sure it’s priced at $0 on day 1 - a call option on a stock trading at $100 with a strike price of $100 is priced at $0 today for tax purposes, but you’d want to receive that option. If you received that option on a dozen stocks, you’d be fairly confident that some of them would be worth a lot more than $0.
Offering this equity (by investing in Skunkworks or offering clients a lower rate) comes out of AE’s margins. Theoretically, we should be lowering salaries to compensate. But we’re competitive on that front as well. Over the long-term, we believe AE employees who stick around are likely to fare extremely well monetarily (no legal promises). We think long-term. You should too when you choose your employer.
We are looking to hire people who think long term. People create exponentially more value here in their 3rd or 4th year rather than their 1st or 2nd, and that only increases. The value you create leads to more equity issued every year, and you retain it while you remain at AE or at a Skunkworks co that spins out, in order to free up equity for others, which is how we afford to be generous with the equity.
Disclaimer: If you leave AE on good terms, you can retain 20% of your equity if you continue to send leads our way, share our core values, etc. If you leave AE for your own AE-incubated Skunkworks project (or someone else’s), you retain 100% of your equity. Folks create exponentially more value here in their 3rd and 4th years than their 1st or 2nd - we want folks who think long-term like we do.
Salary range from $120k/year to $220k/year. Not in the range? That's fine, you can still and our team may fit you in a more senior position that we're not actively hiring right now, but we are growing fast and may have other openings soon.

You understand that the ultimate measurement of success is enabling patients to afford care in a time of need, with a fair rate, in terms they understand. At the end of the day, you want to change the way credit is evaluated.

Build foundational modeling to drive SentiLink’s expanding suite of Fraud and Financial Risk products.
Achieve success by researching / developing through iteration, integration of new data sources and inventive feature engineering.
Write production-ready code that can be relied on for real-time decision making by our partners.
Design, perform, and present analyses that will inform data acquisition, product development, risk operations priorities, marketing, and sales efforts.
Work with engineering, risk operations, and data acquisitions to access necessary data, maintain data quality, and support data access.
Requirements:
4+ years relevant work experience & relevant PhD or 6+ years & relevant Masters.
Proven track record of solving complex / high profile business problems with DS / ML solutions.
Experience in communicating outcomes / progress to senior management / stakeholders.
Very strong in “end to end” DS development: Planning, fleshing out success criteria / metrics, getting buy-in, developing the solution, delivering the solution (prod / deck / strategy doc / etc)
Strong practical ML / Stats knowledge, i.e. can easily employ the suite of standard ML / stats tools to quickly scope out solutions, and double down where needed. Experience with SOTA ML solutions is a plus
Interest in developing deep domain expertise for product-focused work: a background in fraud is not required, but willingness to learn is
Experience writing production code and tests
